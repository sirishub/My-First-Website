        <h1>My First Website!</h1>
        
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My name is Siri, and you are looking at my very first published website! Today, I will tell you a little bit about me! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To skip to different sections and read about me, you can click on the headings (listed below) you want to go to.</h4>

            <li><a href="#coding">Coding</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1 id='coding'>Coding</h1>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, I love to code. I have been coding for a long time, but don't get me wrong when I say 'a long time'. I have just been coding for about a year or so, and I still have much to learn. Aftr all, I <em>am</em> just a 10 year old girl who loves to code. My coding journey is also very interesting, and I learned many things about coding along the way:</p>
        
        <ul class='list'>
            <li>Block Coding</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, here I am now, learning HTML & CSS and making my first website. I'm with you the on fact that my coding journey is <em>shorter</em> than you probably expected, but it was quite of an adventure for me, actually.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, when I started block coding, I thought I was creating an <strong>actual</strong>, <strong>professional</strong> block of code, even though block coding is <em>just a simple languge for beginners</em>. The time I realized that it was <em>just a simple languge for beginners</em>, I knew that I had much, <em>much</em> more to learn.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyhon is actually so much <em>easier</em> than I thought! It also has many cool features. Block coding is fun, especially for beginners, but python's... <em>different</em>, and in a good way.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python gives more freedom to me, since there aren't many options in block coding. In <em>block coding</em>, they <em>give</em> the ready blocks of code, and you can arrange them to your liking, but in <em>python</em>, <em><strong>you</strong></em> can <em><strong>make</strong></em> the lines of code. That would mean that <em><strong>you</strong></em> can design your <em><strong>own</strong></em> 'code blocks'. After all, everyone is different!</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding is really cool, you know. There is so much to see and so much to do. There are many computer languages, like Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS, and many more! It <em>is</em> true that I don't really know so many languages, but I am still eager to learn and grow!</p>
